### Project: To-Do List Application

#### Features:

1. **Add a Task**: Allow users to add tasks to the list. Users can input a task in a text box and add it to the list using a button.
  
2. **Display Tasks**: Display the list of tasks in an organized manner, using HTML lists.

3. **Mark Task as Completed**: Allow users to mark tasks as completed. When a task is marked as completed, visually indicate this with a CSS style (e.g., line-through or color change).

4. **Remove a Task**: Allow users to remove tasks from the list by clicking a delete button next to each task.

5. **Filter Tasks**: Allow users to filter tasks to show all tasks, only completed tasks, or only incomplete tasks.

6. **Local Storage**: Store the task list in the browser's local storage so that tasks persist when the user refreshes the page.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Set Up HTML Structure**:
    - Create an `input` element for the task and an `add` button.
    - Create a container for the task list (e.g., an `ul` or `div` element).
    - Add buttons for filtering tasks (e.g., "All," "Completed," "Incomplete").

2. **Style with CSS**:
    - Style the input field, buttons, and task list for a clean and user-friendly interface.
    - Add styles to differentiate between completed and incomplete tasks.

3. **JavaScript for Functionality**:
    - Add event listeners for adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, removing tasks, and filtering tasks.
    - Write functions to handle adding tasks, marking them as completed, and removing them from the list.
    - Implement local storage to save the tasks and load them when the page is refreshed.
    - Add functionality for filtering tasks.

4. **Test and Debug**:
    - Test the application to ensure all features work as expected.
    - Debug any issues that arise during testing.

5. **Optional Enhancements**:
    - Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.
    - Implement a priority system for tasks.
    - Add a search feature to find tasks by keyword.

This project will help you practice a variety of frontend skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, CSS styling, and local storage usage. It also provides a great starting point for building more complex applications in the future.
